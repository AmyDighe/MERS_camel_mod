# What has changed in this version?

1. variables have been renamed and subsetted to make it more user friendly

2. the random sampling from a poisson distribution for camel births has been corrected
  + previously I had coded it so that a value for the number of births per camel per day was randomly selected from a poisson distribution and then multiplied by the total number of camels (meaning either no camels had a baby that day or ALL camels had a baby that day!)
  + I have now changed it so that a number is picked for each camel for each day and then summed to get the total number of births per day. This got rid of the weird birth peaks seen previously (and confirmed using cat() - thanks!).

3. the rates have been converted to probabilities for use in the model

```{r}
#states
S = 90    #susceptible
I = 10    #infected
R = 0     #recovered
N = S + I + R    #total camel population

#rates of transitions on a given day
b = 0.002 #probability of a birth (per camel)
mu = 0.002 #probability of death
lamda = 0.01 #probability of infection S-->I
sigm = 0.001 #probability of recovery to an immune, non-infectious state I-->R
omega = 0.0002 #probability of immunity waning R-->S


#rates --> probabilities
r2p <- function(r){
  p = 1 - exp(-r)
  print(p)
}

b_prob <- r2p(b)
mu_prob <- r2p(mu)
lamda_prob <- r2p(lamda)
sigm_prob <- r2p(sigm)
omega_prob <- r2p(omega)


#length of time in days for model to run
dy = 365
time = seq(1:(3*dy))

#defining outflows
Outflow_R <- c()
Outflow_S <- c()
Outflow_I <- c()

for(i in 1:(length(time)-1)){
  
  Outflow_R[i] <- rbinom(n = 1, size = R[i], prob = omega_prob + mu_prob)
  Outflow_S[i] <- rbinom(n = 1, size = S[i], prob = lamda_prob + mu_prob)
  Outflow_I[i] <- rbinom(n = 1, size = I[i], prob = sigm_prob + mu_prob)
  
  new_birth <- sum(rpois(n = (S[i]+I[i]+R[i]), lambda = b_prob)) 
  new_waned <- rbinom(n = 1, size = Outflow_R[i], prob = omega_prob/(omega_prob+mu_prob))  
  new_S <- new_birth + new_waned
  dead_S <- rbinom(n = 1, size = Outflow_S[i], prob = mu_prob/(lamda+mu))
  new_infectious <- rbinom(n = 1, size = Outflow_S[i], prob= lamda_prob/(lamda_prob+mu_prob))
  dead_I <- rbinom(n = 1, size = Outflow_I[i], prob = mu_prob/(sigm_prob+mu_prob))
  new_recovered <- rbinom(n = 1, size = Outflow_I[i], prob = sigm_prob/(sigm_prob+mu_prob))
  dead_R <- rbinom(n = 1, size = Outflow_R[i], prob = mu_prob/(omega_prob+mu_prob))
  
  S[i+1] = S[i] + new_birth + new_waned - Outflow_S[i]
  I[i+1] = I[i] + new_infectious - Outflow_I[i]
  R[i+1] = R[i] + new_recovered - Outflow_R[i]
  N[i+1] = S[i+1] + I[i+1] + R[i +1]
}



out <- data.frame(time, S, I, R, N)
matplot(x = out$time, y = out[c(2,3,4,5)], type = "l", lty = 1, lwd = 3, xlab = "time", ylab = "number of individuals")
legend("topright", lwd = 3, lty = 1, col = c("black", "red", "green", "blue"), legend = c("S", "I", "R", "N"))
```

# What still needs to be done?
By sampling from the outflow calculated using the binomial, there is still a chance that by the sum of the two types of transitions could exceed or not reach the outflow as they are not sampled simultaneously

will multinomial fix this?
